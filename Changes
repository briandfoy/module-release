1.12 - Mon Sep 25 22:38:35 CDT 2006

	* Changes from Ken Williams
	
	* New 'makefile_PL' and 'makefile' parameters to the new()
	method allow Module::Build-based distributions to work more
	smoothly - set them to 'Build.PL' and 'Build', respectively.
	
	* The 'release_subclass' parameter to new() is un-deprecated
	again.
	
	* Subclasses previously could not override the new() method
	when invoked via the 'release_subclass' mechanism, now they can.
	
	* When running under a passive FTP mode, we were telling the
	server to go into passive mode twice, which causes some
	servers to bomb out.  This is fixed.
	
	* The error message when an FTP PUT operation failed has been
	improved.
	
	* System calls made during the release process will now read
	their underlying STDOUT and STDERR using read(), which helps
	you see what's going on when there are interactive steps.
	
	* The getpass() method will now check for CPAN_PASS and
	SF_PASS values previously set as member variables.  This
	helps users who might want to, for example, look their
	values up in the OS X keychain using a custom subclass.
	
	* Fixed a couple of minor POD formatting errors.
	
1.10 - Thu Jun  8 06:51:25 2006
	* Distro cleanup (removed sf_login.t test), fixed doc bug about
	PAUSE, cleansed POD. No need to upgrade.

1.08 - Sat May 20 03:04:01 2006
	* Added MANIFEST checking feature. If `make manifest` has to change
	MANIFEST, check_manifest() dies. You'll have to check in MANIFEST
	before you can go on anyway, so you might as well stop and take a
	look at it (and maybe update MANIFEST.SKIP too). I needed this 
	because although I had a lot of pod_coverage tests lying about, 
	they never made it into the dists because I never added them to
	MANIFEST. Stoopid me.
	* This updates the release(1) script too. Make sure you want this
	feature before you overwrite your old release(1).

1.07 - Wed May 17 21:06:39 2006
	* Minor updates to the distro - no code changes. No need to upgrade

0.25 - Fri Dec 17 15:53:15 CST 2004
	* No changes to functionality.
	* Released only because I (Andy) deleted the latest version,
	  because I thought brian had newer ones, when he didn't.
	  This meant that the indexer got all confused.  I hope this
	  stops people from now wondering "Where did Module::Release go?"
	* Modernized t/pod.t
	* Made tests in t/load.t more inclusive
	* Updated the Makefile.PL

0.24 - Sat Nov 29 09:29:36 2003
	* fixed a problem in Module::Release's check_cvs routine where
	it was not checking each line of output

0.23 - Sun Jun 22 23:40:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* All output now goes to the screen if --debug is on.  Thanks to
	Ken Williams.  "High school students."

0.23
	* release will show the user all STDOUT of the subprocesses
	  whenever debug is on.  This will prevent the machine from waiting
	  for a response from you because you don't know it's there.

0.22 - Wed Apr  9 16:05:08 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* release will not run if there are any switch errors

	* Added many error checks in ftp_upload.
    
	* Added some docs on how to find sf_group_id and sf_release_id.

	* Removed a "last CVS" in cvs() method.  It would have
  	  blown up if someone didn't have a CVS directory.

	* Renamed perl() method to build_makefile()

	* Renamed cvs() to check_cvs()

	* Added basic POD docs for the functions

0.21 - Sat Mar 29 16:19:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	Many more patches, thanks to Ken Williams.  I fear it won't be
	long until Module::Release is sending & receiving mail.

	* release only checks for passwords if they're necessary.
	  This means you don't have to have a password if you're running
	  "release -t" to test.

	* A more complete dependency list in Makefile.PL

	* A new 'release_subclass' config file entry lets you subclass
	  Module::Release.  There's an example in the docs.

	* After FTP upload, we check to see whether the two versions of
	  the file have the same size.	This should catch my FTP-ing bug.

	* The cvs_tag() method now calls make_cvs_tag() to make the
	  tag string.  This lets me override make_cvs_tag() in a subclass.

0.20 - Wed Mar 26 11:05:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* Moved all the real work into Module::Release.  Thanks to 
	Ken Williams for doing all the dirty work on this.

	* Fixed the Test::Pod dependency

0.16 - Wed Mar 19 15:38:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* No new features
	* Removed the dependency on Test::Pod

0.15 - Fri Mar 14 17:23:30 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* Support for the PERL environment variable.
	* Cleaned up tabs 'n' spaces in the source.  Shouldn't
	  affect anything in how you use the program.

0.14 - Wed Mar 12 10:09:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* 0.13 is an incorrect distro.  This is what you want.

0.13 - Wed Mar 12 09:58:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	Most of these changes are from Max Maischein.  Cross-platform
	compatibility should be a lot better.  Thanks, Max!

	* Prompts for passwords that are not set in the environment.

	* Fixed a bug in checking for required fields

	* Uses "$Config{make}" instead of "make".

	* Moved all backticks into a subroutine "run", that also echoes
	  the command if "-d" is set.

	* Added a check whether the file-to-distribute actually exists,
	  before making the ftp connection.

	* The regex to guess the distname from the tardist output
	  needed some whitespace added to work with Win32.

	* Added support for passive FTP.

0.12 - Thu Mar  6 13:55:47 2003 (Andy Lester)
	Most of the changes in this revision are from Chris Nandor:

	* Add basic help page
	
	* Add more debugging information (dump `` output)

	* Add command-line switches for help, debug, and test (exits after
	  testing phase)

	* Allow not using either the CPAN or SourceForge.net (but not both)

	* Check cvs exit status

	* Do not update CVS automatically; release will exit if it sees a U
	  anyway, so might as well just let the developer handle it

	* Allow modification of "release name" via regex in .releaserc

	* Update docs

	* General cleanup

0.11 - Mon Mar  3 11:58:42 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* Patches to make this less brian-specific.  Thanks to Chris
	  Nandor for taking it upon himself to do so.

	* Removed a lot of dependencies on external modules. 

0.10 - Wed Dec 11 16:40:53 2002 (brian d foy)
	* prompt for comments to put in Changes, commit Changes, and
	use comments in SourceForge change log notes

	* guess the release file name from 'make dist' so the first
	argument is now optional

	* put the right date in the SourceForge release date
