0.25 - Fri Dec 17 15:53:15 CST 2004
	* No changes to functionality.
	* Released only because I (Andy) deleted the latest version,
	  because I thought brian had newer ones, when he didn't.
	  This meant that the indexer got all confused.  I hope this
	  stops people from now wondering "Where did Module::Release go?"
	* Modernized t/pod.t
	* Made tests in t/load.t more inclusive
	* Updated the Makefile.PL

0.24 - Sat Nov 29 09:29:36 2003
	* fixed a problem in Module::Release's check_cvs routine where
	it was not checking each line of output

0.23 - Sun Jun 22 23:40:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* All output now goes to the screen if --debug is on.  Thanks to
	Ken Williams.  "High school students."

0.23
	* release will show the user all STDOUT of the subprocesses
	  whenever debug is on.  This will prevent the machine from waiting
	  for a response from you because you don't know it's there.

0.22 - Wed Apr  9 16:05:08 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* release will not run if there are any switch errors

	* Added many error checks in ftp_upload.
    
	* Added some docs on how to find sf_group_id and sf_release_id.

	* Removed a "last CVS" in cvs() method.  It would have
  	  blown up if someone didn't have a CVS directory.

	* Renamed perl() method to build_makefile()

	* Renamed cvs() to check_cvs()

	* Added basic POD docs for the functions

0.21 - Sat Mar 29 16:19:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	Many more patches, thanks to Ken Williams.  I fear it won't be
	long until Module::Release is sending & receiving mail.

	* release only checks for passwords if they're necessary.
	  This means you don't have to have a password if you're running
	  "release -t" to test.

	* A more complete dependency list in Makefile.PL

	* A new 'release_subclass' config file entry lets you subclass
	  Module::Release.  There's an example in the docs.

	* After FTP upload, we check to see whether the two versions of
	  the file have the same size.	This should catch my FTP-ing bug.

	* The cvs_tag() method now calls make_cvs_tag() to make the
	  tag string.  This lets me override make_cvs_tag() in a subclass.

0.20 - Wed Mar 26 11:05:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* Moved all the real work into Module::Release.  Thanks to 
	Ken Williams for doing all the dirty work on this.

	* Fixed the Test::Pod dependency

0.16 - Wed Mar 19 15:38:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* No new features
	* Removed the dependency on Test::Pod

0.15 - Fri Mar 14 17:23:30 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* Support for the PERL environment variable.
	* Cleaned up tabs 'n' spaces in the source.  Shouldn't
	  affect anything in how you use the program.

0.14 - Wed Mar 12 10:09:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* 0.13 is an incorrect distro.  This is what you want.

0.13 - Wed Mar 12 09:58:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	Most of these changes are from Max Maischein.  Cross-platform
	compatibility should be a lot better.  Thanks, Max!

	* Prompts for passwords that are not set in the environment.

	* Fixed a bug in checking for required fields

	* Uses "$Config{make}" instead of "make".

	* Moved all backticks into a subroutine "run", that also echoes
	  the command if "-d" is set.

	* Added a check whether the file-to-distribute actually exists,
	  before making the ftp connection.

	* The regex to guess the distname from the tardist output
	  needed some whitespace added to work with Win32.

	* Added support for passive FTP.

0.12 - Thu Mar  6 13:55:47 2003 (Andy Lester)
	Most of the changes in this revision are from Chris Nandor:

	* Add basic help page
	
	* Add more debugging information (dump `` output)

	* Add command-line switches for help, debug, and test (exits after
	  testing phase)

	* Allow not using either the CPAN or SourceForge.net (but not both)

	* Check cvs exit status

	* Do not update CVS automatically; release will exit if it sees a U
	  anyway, so might as well just let the developer handle it

	* Allow modification of "release name" via regex in .releaserc

	* Update docs

	* General cleanup

0.11 - Mon Mar  3 11:58:42 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* Patches to make this less brian-specific.  Thanks to Chris
	  Nandor for taking it upon himself to do so.

	* Removed a lot of dependencies on external modules. 

0.10 - Wed Dec 11 16:40:53 2002 (brian d foy)
	* prompt for comments to put in Changes, commit Changes, and
	use comments in SourceForge change log notes

	* guess the release file name from 'make dist' so the first
	argument is now optional

	* put the right date in the SourceForge release date
