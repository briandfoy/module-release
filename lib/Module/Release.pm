=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Module::Release> automates your software release process. It started as
a script that automated my release process, so it has bits to
talk to PAUSE (CPAN) and SourceForge, and to use C<Makefile.PL> and
C<CVS>. Other people have extended this in other modules under the same
namespace so you can use C<Module::Build>, C<svn>, and many other things.

The methods represent a step in the release process. Some of them check a
condition (e.g. all tests pass) and die if that doesn't work.
C<Module::Release> doesn't let you continue if something is wrong. Once
you have checked everything, use the upload features to send your files
to the right places.

The included C<release> script is a good starting place. Don't be afraid to
edit it for your own purposes.

=head2 Configuration

C<Module::Release> looks at several sources for configuration information.

=head3 Perl setup

C<Module::Release> looks at C<Config> to get the values it needs for
certain operations.

=over 4

=item make

The name of the program to run for the C<make> steps

=back

=head3 Environment variables

=over 4

=item PERL

Use this value as the perl interpreter, otherwise use the value in C<$^X>.

=item RELEASE_DEBUG

Do you want debugging output? Set this to a true value

=item SF_PASS

Your SourceForge password. If you don't set this and you want to
upload to SourceForge, you should be prompted for it. Failing that,
the module tries to upload anonymously but cannot claim the file for
you.

=item CPAN_PASS

Your CPAN password. If you don't set this and you want to upload to
PAUSE, you should be prompted for it. Failing that, the module tries
to upload anonymously but cannot claim the file for you.

=back

=head3 C<.releaserc>

C<Module::Release> looks for either C<.releaserc> or C<releaserc> in
the current working directory. It reads that with
C<ConfigReader::Simple> to get these values:

=over 4

=item release_subclass (DEPRECATED)

The subclass of C<Module::Release> that you want to use. This allows
you to specify the subclass via a F<.releaserc> file; otherwise you
wouldn't be able to use the C<release> script because the
C<Module::Release> class name is hard-coded there.

=item makefile_PL

The name of the file to run as F<Makefile.PL>.  The default is
C<"Makefile.PL">, but you can set it to C<"Build.PL"> to use a
C<Module::Build>-based system.

=item makefile

The name of the file created by C<makefile_PL> above.  The default is
C<"Makefile">, but you can set it to C<"Build"> for
C<Module::Build>-based systems.

=item cpan_user

Your PAUSE user id.

=item sf_user

Your SourceForge account (i.e. login) name.

=item passive_ftp

Set this to a true value to enable passive FTP.

=item ignore_prereqs

A whitespace separated list of modules for C<Test::Prereq> to ignore.

=back

=head2 Methods

If you don't like what any of these methods do, override them in a subclass.

=over 4

=item new()

Create the bare bones C<Module::Release> object so you can read the
configuration file. If you can read the configuration file, check for
the C<release_subclass> directive. If the C<release_subclass> is there,
C<new> calls the subclass's C<new> and returns the result. Otehrwise,
this C<new> calls C<init> to set up the object.

If you make a subclass, you're responsible for everything, including
reading the configuration and adding it to your object.

=cut

sub new
	{
	my( $class, %params ) = @_;

	my $self = bless {}, $class;

	# NOTE: I have to read the configuration to see if I should
	# call the subclass, but I haven't called init yet.
	# Don't set up anything in _read_configuration!

			$config->release_subclass, %params );

		return $subclass_self;
		}

	$self->init( $config, %params );

	return $self;
	}


=item init()

Set up the C<Module::Release> object. By default, it expects something
using MakeMaker, but if it sees a F<Build.PL> it configures itself for
C<Module::Build>.

The values in the configuration file override any settings here, so if you
have both a F<Makefile.PL> and a F<Build.PL> then you can override the
C<Module::Build> preference by setting the C<makefile_PL> and C<make>
configuration values.

=item load_mixin( MODULE )

EXPERIMENTAL!!

Load MODULE through require (so no importing), without caring what it does.
My intent is that MODULE adds methods to the C<Module::Release> namespace
so a release object can see it. This should probably be some sort of
delegation.

=item config

Get the configuration object. By default this is a C<ConfigReader::Simple>
object;

=cut

sub config { $_[0]->{config} }

=item get_web_user_agent

Get a web user agent that follows the LWP::UserAgent API. The first time
you call this it also sets up the web client by calling C<setup_web_client>.

=cut

sub get_web_user_agent { $_[0]->{web_user_agent} || $_[0]->setup_web_user_agent }

=item setup_web_user_agent( ARGS )

Create a web user agent and store it in the object. Get a reference to it
by saving the result or calling C<get_web_user_agent>. If you call this
method again, it replaces the internal web user agent (and anything you've
done to it since you first set it up). It passes any arguments to the
constructor of the user agent class.

It calls C<web_user_agent_name> to set the initial agent name, and sets
up an empty, in-memory cookie jar.

The user agent name to use with web requests. Let's just call that
C<Mozilla> for now.

the literal argument C<undef> to clear the value.

=item set_perl

Set the current path for the perl binary that C<Module::Release> should
use for general tasks. This is not related to the list of perls used to
test multiple binaries unless you use one of those binaries to set a new
value.

If PATH looks like a perl binary, C<set_perl> uses it as the new setting
for perl and returns the previous value.

Add a perl binary to the list of perls to use for testing. If PATH
is not executable or cannot run C<print $]>, this method returns
nothing and does not add PATH. Otherwise, it returns true. If the
same path was already in the list, it returns true but does not
create a duplicate.

=item check_manifest

Run `make manifest` and report anything it finds. If it gives output,
die. You should check C<MANIFEST> to ensure it has the things it needs.
If files that shouldn't show up do, put them in MANIFEST.SKIP.

Since `make manifest` takes care of things for you, you might just have
to re-run your release script.

=item vcs_tag

=item make_vcs_tag

Note: these methods were formerly "cvs", but are now "vcs" for
Version Control System.

This is a placeholder method which should be implemented in a mixin
module. Try installing Module::Release::CVS, Module::Release::SVN,
or Module::Release::Git and then loading them in your script. The
default C<release> script does this for you by checking for the
special directories for those source systems.

Previous to version 1.24, these methods were implemented in this
module to support CVS. They are now in Module::Release::CVS as a
separate module.

=item touch( FILES )

Set the modification times of each file in FILES to the current time. It
tries to open the file for writing and immediately closing it, as well as
using utime. It checks that the access and modification times were
updated.

do when a command doesn't work. You may want to handle that yourself.

=item _print( LIST )

Send the LIST to whatever is in output_fh, or to STDOUT. If you set
output_fh to a null filehandle, output goes nowhere.

Send the LIST to whatever is in debug_fh, or to STDERR. If you aren't

* What happened to my Changes munging?

=head1 CREDITS

Ken Williams turned my initial release(1) script into the present
module form.

Andy Lester handled the maintenance while I was on my Big Camping
Trip. He applied patches from many authors.

Andreas König suggested changes to make it work better with PAUSE.

Chris Nandor helped with figuring out the broken SourceForge stuff.

H.Merijn Brand has contributed many patches and features.
